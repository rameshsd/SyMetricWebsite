/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SyMetric Systems platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset balances open access for community content with strict user ownership for personal data.
 * Community posts are publicly readable, but require authentication to create, update, or delete.
 * User profiles are private, with each user only able to access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /communityPosts/{communityPostId}: Stores community posts. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Owner-only access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Community posts are publicly readable to allow for open community access.
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations are protected by authentication checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Community posts include the `authorId` field, which is used to determine ownership for write operations, avoiding costly `get()` calls.
