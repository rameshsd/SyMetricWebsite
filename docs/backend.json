    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure prioritizes ease of access for community posts while adhering to the principle of Authorization Independence. Community posts are stored in a top-level collection called `communityPosts`. This enables anonymous users to read all posts, fulfilling the requirement for open community access.  For users to create posts, authentication via the `authorId` field is required in the rules, which links back to the `/users/{userId}` collection. This keeps public read access separate from authenticated write access. This flat structure, combined with the inclusion of the `authorId` within the `communityPosts` documents, avoids the need for `get()` calls in the security rules, ensuring Authorization Independence.  The segregation of concerns into a single collection simplifies querying and security rule management."
